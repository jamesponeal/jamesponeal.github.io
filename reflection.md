###This is my reflection entry for Lesson 3.5: Your Website Part 3:

In this lesson, we had to add stylesheets to our personal website that we started last week.  This was a fun and educational lesson for me.

We were asked to include a link to our site which can be found [*here*](http://jamesponeal.github.io).

We were also asked to answer the following questions:

####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
My understanding of them was reinforced in some ways, but I also discovered that I do not fully understand some things.  I had other elements that moved when I adjusted the margin, but did not move when I adjusted the padding.  I am still working on figuring out why.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that it is sometimes tedious and frustrating to get things to move where I want, but I know this will become easier with time.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I suppose the easiest to implement was just the text.  The most difficult to implement was either my 'cover photo' on my main page, or the navigation bar.  Both required some trial error to get them to look the way I wanted.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Mainly I reinforced my knowledge of centering and positioning elements, sizing, and linking different pages together.  Using the blog page, I also used my first actual cascading stylesheet which was exciting.

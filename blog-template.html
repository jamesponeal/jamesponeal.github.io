This is my reflection for the peer-pairing exercise 2.7: Blog Setup

For this exercise, I paired with Steven King.  As part of this exercise, we had to create a wireframe
for what will be a blog page.  We created the page using a free online software called Cacoo.
The link to this file is shown below:

The exercise also asked to answer the following questions:

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a good experience, my pair and I had similar ideas as far as how to lay the page out and what
should be on it, so the wireframing and HTML file went fairly quickly.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, wireframing let us envision how the page was going to look and helped guide us in what should be
in the html file.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Keep it simple was our main philosophy.  At this point we know that this is going to be evolving and
could change, so we didn't want to get too detailed or crazy.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We did a search on semantic elements and found some great resources.  Really the only new one that we
used at this point was the footer tag.

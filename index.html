    <p>Hello, my name is Jim.  I am originally from a small town on Michigan's west coast and relocated to Chicago, IL in October 2013.  I have a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Western Michigan University and worked as an engineer for 15 years, mostly in the manufacturing industry designing brakes and axles for heavy equipment, followed by some time in the nuclear power industry running seismic analysis on power plants. I felt that my creative side and problem solving skills were not being fulfilled, so I decided to embark on a career change into web development.  I am currently attending DevBootcamp, an accelerated web development trade school, to help acheive my goal of becoming a web development professional.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include swing dancing, volleyball, kickboxing, movies, anything outside in the summer, hanging out with friends, good beer, and waffles... you can never have enough waffles.</p>

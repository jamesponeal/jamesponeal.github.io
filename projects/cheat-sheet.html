    <h2>SQL Cheat Sheet</h2>
    <h4>by Jim O'Neal on January 6, 2016</h4>
    <section>
      <p>SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases. A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.</p>
      <p>
      <u>CREATE TABLE</u> creates a new table.<br>
      <u>INSERT INTO</u> adds a new row to a table.<br>
      <u>SELECT</u> queries data from a table.<br>
      <u>UPDATE</u> edits a row in a table.<br>
      <u>ALTER TABLE</u> changes an existing table.<br>
      <u>DELETE FROM</u> deletes rows from a table.<br>
      <u>WHERE</u> is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.<br>
      <u>LIKE</u> and <u>BETWEEN</u> are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause.<br>
      <u>AND</u> and <u>OR</u> are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.<br>
      <u>ORDER BY</u> lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.<br>
      <u>LIMIT</u> lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.</p>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p class="codewide">
      SELECT name, imdb_rating FROM movies;<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating > 8;<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE '%man%';<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000 AND genre = 'comedy';<br>
      SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC;<br>
      SELECT * FROM books WHERE author="Jodi Picoult" ORDER BY year_published;<br>
      (Note: 'DESC' means descending and 'ASC' means ascending)<br>
      </p>

      <p><strong>SQL Aggregate Functions:</strong></p>

      <p>Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.</p>
      <p>
      <u>COUNT</u> takes the name of a column(s) as an argument and counts the number of rows where the value(s) is not NULL.<br>
      <u>GROUP BY</u> is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.<br>
      <u>SUM()</u> takes the column name as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.<br>
      <u>MAX()</u> takes the column name as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.<br>
      <u>MIN()</u> takes the column name as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column.<br>
      <u>AVG()</u> takes a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.<br>
      <u>ROUND()</u> takes two arguments, a column name and the number of decimal places to round the values in that column.</p>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p class="codewide">
      SELECT price, ROUND(AVG(downloads)) FROM fake_apps GROUP BY price;</p>

      <p><strong>SQL Multiple Tables:</strong></p>
      <p>
      <u>Primary Key</u> is a column that serves a unique identifier for row in the table. Values in this column must be unique and cannot be NULL.<br>
      <u>Foreign Key</u> is a column that contains the primary key to another table in the database. It is used to identify a particular row in the referenced table.<br>
      <br>
      Joins are used in SQL to combine data from multiple tables.<br>
      <u>INNER JOIN</u> will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.<br>
      <u>LEFT OUTER JOIN</u> will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.<br>
      <u>AS</u> is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table in the result set using an alias.
      </p>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p class="codewide">
      SELECT * FROM albums JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;<br>
      SELECT region_name, state_name FROM regions JOIN states ON regions.id = states.region_id ORDER BY region_id ASC;</p>

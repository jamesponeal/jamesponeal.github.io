  <h2>My Blogging Experience</h2>

      <p>
        Nine weeks ago I started on a journey with DevBootcamp to learn how to build websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and jQuery.  During this time, among many interesting and challenging Ruby and JavaScript challenges, I have also built a personal website and this blog page that you are reading now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most challenging part of building this website along the way, technically has been working CSS. Getting things to position and display correctly has been a challenge, but has definitely become easier over the last few weeks.  But the real challenge has not been anything technical, it has been making decisions on content, and artistic decisions on the layout, the look, and the feel of the site.  I definitely have a new respect for sites with good aesthetics, and the planning it took to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, building and maintaining this personal website has been a great experience, as has the weekly blogging.  I plan to keep up the blogging through the onsite portion of DevBootcamp, and continue to add new things to my projects page.

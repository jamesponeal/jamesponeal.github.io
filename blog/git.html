  <h2>Lesson 1.7 - Technical Blog</h2>
  <h4>by Jim O'Neal on November 15, 2015</h4>

      <p>
        This is my first blog entry for DevBootcamp phase 0.  My first entry is in regards to lesson 1.7, which is titled "Technical Blog".  There are three questions to be answered in this lesson:
        What are the benefits of version control?
        How does git help you keep track of changes?
        Why use GitHub to store your code?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few benefits of version control.  It helps you collaborate with different developers who are working on the same project, it allows you to easily merge changed sections of a project back into a master file, and it allows for restoring a previous version if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is a version control software, it helps you track your changes by allowing you to see the history of a file, shows previous versions, and gives an easy snapshot of what was changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Github is useful as a place to store code because it allows other developers who are working on the same project to access the code from different locations, and ensures that everyone starts from the same master file.
